# ML--Breast-Cancer-Classification
# Breast Cancer Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques to the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The goal is to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign using various machine learning algorithms.

#Dataset

The dataset used is the load_breast_cancer dataset from the sklearn.datasets module. It consists of:

569 samples

30 numeric features

2 target classes: Malignant (0) and Benign (1)

# Objectives

Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and check for missing values.

Perform feature scaling to standardize the dataset for distance-based algorithms.

Classification Algorithms:

Implement and evaluate the following models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Model Comparison:

Compare models based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.


# Results

The notebook evaluates models based on accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices. A bar chart is provided to compare the accuracy scores of different algorithms.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms for breast cancer classification. It highlights their performance and compares them to find the best-performing model.
